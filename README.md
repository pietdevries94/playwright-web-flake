# Playwright Web Flake

This nix flake provides a way to install [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and its browsers in a nixos system.
It does not contain playwright-python, because for my personal use I don't need it and it sometimes lags behind the latest version of playwright.

## Usage

TODO: Add proper usage instructions.

## Versioning

The update workflow tags the commit with the version of playwright that is installed. This version can be used to checkout the commit that installed that version of playwright, to match your environment.
